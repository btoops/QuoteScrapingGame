This project was to practice ethical webscrapping with BeautifulSoup by scrapping on http://quotes.toscrape.com which allows webscrapping.

I webscrape the website (scraper.py) with a slight delay (2 seconds) to prevent sending many signals to the website's server in a short duration.
To prevent a delay in the game, I save the scraped data into a csv file to reduce the run time of the game.
